Summary: Learn more about me.

Hello there! This is my blog/portfolio/thought website. 

My hope is that, by writing about stuff I'm working on or thinking about here, 
I'll be more motivated to pursue side programming and hardware projects.

School and extracurriculars take up most of my time, so I try to
get an article or a small project finished during winter and summer breaks.

I had a SDE internship with Amazon this past summer, and I've had
experience with teaching and with creating
open-source projects through working with some PhD students
at UMD. If you're interested in contacting me, links to my LinkedIn
and Twitter are at the bottom of the page.

My current project is: experimenting with making an app with BeeWare, and
working on OccupancyViz, an open-source library for
visualizing LIDAR occupancy grid data (not publicly released, yet).
