Summary: Learn more about me.

Hello there! This is my blog/portfolio/thought website. Though this website has
not been updated since January at the time of me writing this, I hope to
push more updates concerning my activities as a college student and as a developer.

My hope is that, by writing about stuff I'm working on or thinking about here, 
I'll be more motivated to pursue side activities. 

As a CS & Math double major, student-initiated course facilitator, sometimes TA,
and debate team member, school and its extracurriculars take most of my time, 
but I enjoy summer and winter breaks where I can sit down and work on software
projects all the time. 

My current project is building some sort of adventurer game with Python & Pygame.
